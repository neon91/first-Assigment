                <h1>INLAY</h1>
                <p>The Inlay Lake Biosphere Reserve is located in Taunggyi District, Southern Shan State. Inlay Lake is
                    a freshwater lake and reportedly the second largest inland lake in Myanmar. The Inlay Lake wetland
                    ecosystem is home to 267 species of birds of which 82 are wetland birds, 43 species of freshwater
                    fish, otters and turtles. In addition, freshwater fish from the inland wetland constitute the major
                    protein food source of the people of Inlay. The reserve hosts diverse flora and fauna species and
                    the lake is reported to be the nesting place for the globally endangered Sarus crane (Grus
                    antigone).

                    Inlay Lake is also unique for the socio-cultural aspects of the local inhabitants, who have adapted
                    their lifestyle and livelihoods to their biophysical environment. The majority earn their income
                    from traditional methods of hydroponic farming, fishing and shifting cultivation. Farmers from one
                    of the dominant ethnic groups in the Inlay Lake region, the Inthas, practice floating island
                    agriculture, locally known as ‘Yechan’, a form of hydroponic farming. </p>

                    <h5>Economy</h5>
                    <p>Certain villages on and around Inlay Lake specialise in particular handicrafts such as Phaw Kone
                        Village (silk and lotus weaving),
                        Kyaut Taing (pottery), Ywa-ma (gold and silver wares), Se-khong (blacksmiths) so explore, admire
